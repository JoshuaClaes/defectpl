# Photoluminescence

This page contains the details of how to calculate the photoluminescence spectra. 
The partial Huang-Rhys (HR) factor S$_i$ and total HR factor S are given by,
    $S_i  = \frac{\omega_i q_i^2} {2 \hbar}; S = \sum S_i$

where $\omega_i$ is the frequency of the $i$-th phonon mode.
