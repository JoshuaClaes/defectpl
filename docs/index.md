## 📌 Purpose

**DefectPL** is designed to compute the photoluminescence intensity of point defects in solids using the methodology described in *New J. Phys. 16 (2014) 073026*. It also provides tools to calculate and plot related quantities such as:

- Partial Huang-Rhys factors
- Huang-Rhys factor
- Debye-Waller factor
- Inverse participation ratios (IPR)  
- Localization ratios  
- Vibrational displacements  
- Effect of Isotope substitution
- Photoluminescence Spectra in the High Huang-Rhys Factor Regime
