Purpose
-------

**DefectPL** is designed to compute the photoluminescence intensity of point defects in solids using the methodology described in *New J. Phys. 16 (2014) 073026*. It also provides tools to calculate and plot related quantities such as:

- Partial Huang-Rhys factors
- Huang-Rhys factor
- Debye-Waller factor
- Inverse participation ratios (IPR)
- Localization ratios
- Vibrational displacements
- Effect of Isotope substitution
- Photoluminescence Spectra in the High Huang-Rhys Factor Regime

Example Usage
-------------

Hereâ€™s a minimal example using data for a negative NV center in diamond::

   from defectpl.defectpl import DefectPl

   band_yaml = "../tests/data/band.yaml"
   contcar_gs = "../tests/data/CONTCAR_gs"
   contcar_es = "../tests/data/CONTCAR_es"
   out_dir = "./plots"
   EZPL = 1.95
   gamma = 2
   plot_all = True
   iplot_xlim = [1000, 2000]

   defctpl = DefectPl(
       band_yaml,
       contcar_gs,
       contcar_es,
       EZPL,
       gamma,
       iplot_xlim=iplot_xlim,
       plot_all=plot_all,
       out_dir=out_dir,
   )
